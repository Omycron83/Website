Hi, my name is Damian and I love working at and studying the intersection of math and cs in the field of machine learning.
Over the course of the years, what begun with a curious click in tenth grade and a general interest in STEM blossomed into a passion
fueled by hard work, dedication and the early success both provided. Growing up into a fast-moving field with new advances 
repeatedly challenging the status quo has taught me to stay updated on the latest literature and industry developments.

Thus, nowadays I'm looking to further my studies in both fields, get an even deeper understanding of the fundamentals,
gather more and more practical experience and hopefully contribute to the latest research as soon as my studies allow it :)
