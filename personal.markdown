In my freetime, I love meeting up with friends and doing sport,
mostly swimming, bouldering, hiking as well as going to the gym <3.
I don't really like to party hard or drink, but instead aim 
to spend quality time with those nearest to me.

Furthermore, I like to volunteer at a local homeless shelter organized by the Johanniter e.V. where we provide guests with a 
warm meal for the evening, offer them a bed to come back to as well as securely storing their 
belongings for the night, 365 days a year.
