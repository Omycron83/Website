In my freetime, I love meeting up with friends and doing sport, mostly swimming, bouldering, hiking as well as going to the gym <3.
I don't really like to party hard or drink (at least not that often lol), but instead aim to spend quality time with those nearest to me. 
After all, its all about enjoying the important experiences rather than chasing illusive ideals or material goods.

Furthermore, I love volunteering at a local homeless shelter organized by the Johanniter e.V. where we provide guests with a 
warm meal for the evening, offer them a bed to come back to as well as securely storing their belongings for the night. 
I think its important to contribute to ones' community and I feel its a very important issue that needs more attention and care.
Not so fun-fact: did you know that in the entirety of berlin, there are only about 200 beds in **total** for homeless men in the summer :(?
